# hello-world
This is my initial repository as I go through a tutorial learning github
Making a big boy job career change and getting into application development. Want to learn full stack REST development for both work and my aspiring side hobby mobile/PC game development.
Also may contain role playing campain works. May have 2 accounts, one for work and one for game development after learning the ropes of this site, to keep things neat and orderly.
